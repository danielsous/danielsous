### Hi there 👋, I'm Daniel

-🌱 I'm currently learning about gamedev, especially using UnrealEngine 5.

-🤯 I love getting to know everything, even though I know I won't be an expert in everything, let alone work with it, but knowledge and curiosity speak louder.

-😎 I've been practising development since I was 14 years old, but I've only been in the field professionally for 3 years.

-🐱‍👤 I'm very familiar with JavaScript, NodeJS, cSharp (C#) and I'm starting to study C++.

- I have knowledge of SQL (Sql Server and PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB), AWS, serveless, docker, and a few other technologies that are necessary on a daily basis.
